# 🧠 HNG 13 — Backend Stage 0 Task

Welcome to my **HNG 13 Backend Track Stage 0 Task**!  
This task marks the beginning of my backend engineering journey in the HNG Internship 13 program. 🚀  

---

## 📜 Task Description

The **Stage 0 Backend Task** requires interns to build a simple API endpoint that returns basic personal information in **JSON format**.  
The goal is to demonstrate understanding of backend fundamentals — routing, JSON responses, and deployment.

---

## 🧩 Task Requirements

You are required to:

1. Create an endpoint `/me` that returns the following information:
   - **email** – your HNG-registered email address  
   - **current_datetime** – current date and time in **ISO 8601 format (UTC)**  
   - **github_url** – link to the GitHub repository containing your source code  

2. Host your API on any live platform (e.g., Railway, Render, Vercel, etc.)  
3. Push your project code to GitHub  
4. Submit your **live API endpoint** and **GitHub repo link**

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **Node.js** — Backend runtime environment  
- **Express.js** — For building the server and handling routing  
- **Railway** — For deployment  
- **GitHub** — For version control and source hosting
